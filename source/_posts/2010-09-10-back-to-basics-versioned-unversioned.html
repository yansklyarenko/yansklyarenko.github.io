<p>It is well-known that each field of a template can be versioned (default option), unversioned or shared. The Template Builder UI exposes the Unversioned and Shared properties as two independent checkboxes. And thus, despite it’s a very basic Sitecore concept, it is sometimes asked <a href="http://sdn.sitecore.net/forum//ShowPost.aspx?PostID=29034">what’s the point of marking a field both shared and unversioned</a>. The answer is “a field marked both shared and unversioned is still a shared field”. Think about “shared” as a superset of “unversioned” – the field can’t be shared (between all versions of all languages) without being unversioned (between all versions of one language).</p>  <p>Let’s see how it works under the hood when the field “sharing” level is changed. Let’s create a simple template with just a single field. We’ll keep the defaults so far (versioned). Now create a content item based on this template and fill in the field. </p>  <p>Sitecore fields are stored in three different tables inside the database: VersionedFields, UnversionedFields and SharedFields. The names are quite self-explanatory. Let’s run the following SQL query:</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <font color="#0000ff">SELECT * FROM VersionedFields WHERE FieldId = '{GUID-GOES-HERE-…}'</font></p>  <p>As a result, one record is returned – the field information of the item we’ve just created is stored in the VersionedFields table. The similar queries for UnversionedFields and SharedFields give 0 records. </p>  <p>Now change the field to be Unversioned and run all 3 queries again – it will return 1 record for UnversionedFields table and 0 for others. Change the field to be both Shared and Unversioned and repeat the experiment – the field info now resides in SharedFields table. Now if you uncheck Unversioned and leave it just Shared, it will still show 1 record for SharedFields table and 0 for others. So, here’s the evidence!</p>  <p>NOTE: changing the field “sharing” level might result in a data loss (similar to type cast operation in C#), and Sitecore warns you about it.</p>  <p>You might think that two checkboxes are to be blamed for this confusion. Check out the hot VS extension called <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/44a26c88-83a7-46f6-903c-5c59bcd3d35b/view">Sitecore Rocks</a> – a brand new tool (CTP for now) for developers working with Sitecore projects in VS 2010. It seems to look more natural in this way, isn’t it?</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_dqWPbhO6dtA/TIlsZANnP8I/AAAAAAAAAXA/3E97dawvRnU/s1600-h/RocksDesignTemplate%5B4%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="RocksDesignTemplate" border="0" alt="RocksDesignTemplate" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_dqWPbhO6dtA/TIlsZ1BB5aI/AAAAAAAAAXE/OHGbPYeLP2s/RocksDesignTemplate_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="178" /></a></p>  </div>
