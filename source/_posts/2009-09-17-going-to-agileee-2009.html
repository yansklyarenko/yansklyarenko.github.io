<p>Today I’m heading to the <a href="http://agileee.org/">Agileee 2009 conference</a> being held in Kiev on September, 18 – 19th. This is rather new field to me – I’ve never been practicing Agile or Scrum before. We’ll see how it goes. At least, I’m expecting to learn many new and interesting things and see how to apply this in the Modules team.</p>  </div>
